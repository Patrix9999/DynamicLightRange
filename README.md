# Introduction

This project is a union plugin that restores the cut feature that was present in **Gothic 1** into **Gothic 2** and **Gothic 2 Night of The Raven**, that allows light vobs range to be animated and interpolated by scaling factors.  
Keep in mind that altough original spacer does has options for setting up the animation, it won't show it, because the spacer.exe binary isn't 100% compatible with game binary.  
That means, that the only way to use and see this feature, is by using **Spacer.NET**, that supports it well (because it operates on the original game).

# Demonstration

Below image shows how this feature works in **Spacer.NET**
